# Bootstrap_FF6
Bootstrap of you're portfolio based on a 6 factor model. 
Very rough first version. Some comments in the code to make it understable. Probably still some bugs when you add different markets so be carefull with results. 
Hope to rewrite it a bit better in the fiture, all suggestions are welcome.
